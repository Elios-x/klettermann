  "bio": "Thank you for visiting my profile. I am Guatemalan. In early 2019, I started working in Qatar as an industrial climber and equipment installer for the event industry with an IRATA Level 1 certification.\n\nIn 2022, the year I moved to Germany, I served as a senior rigger managing installation and maintenance operations in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar. These tasks involved dismantling and replacing parts on lifting and load-bearing systems above people, inspecting and installing electrical cabling networks, and intranet systems for operating automated motorized systems.\n\nIn Germany, I am certified as an industrial climber under FISAT Level 2 and a certified MEWP operator with IPAF. My goal is to work in a position where I can apply and further develop my technical skills. I am used to demanding work environments with high safety standards, take great care in maintaining equipment, and appreciate solution-oriented workplaces."
